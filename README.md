# Modeling and Analysis of a Flexible Spine Quadruped
Created a simscape model for a flexible spine quadruped based on the images in the articles in Repo.

The project is completed using Simscape tool in MATLAB and the models are developed in MATLAB 2024b.
As given in the problem statement, the project is done in 3 stages. 
Each stage has corresponding matlab script which generates the required path using inverse kinematics for the legs of quadraped which is used in movement of the robot's legs and calculation of required torques and forces.

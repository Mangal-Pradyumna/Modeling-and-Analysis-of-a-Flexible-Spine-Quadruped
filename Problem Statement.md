Take a look at the papers attached. Create a simscape model for a flexible spine quadruped based on the images in these papers, in stages.

- Stage 1 - create a planar biped model, i.e. a cross-section model of the quadrupeds shown in the paper. To the tip of each leg bottom prescribe some cyclic motion. The motion should be out of phase but same frequency for the front and back legs. Visualise and analyse the motion. Create graphs and gifs of the movement.

- Stage 2 - the actual motion of the biped above is discontinuous. It occurs by the back leg pushing upwards and forward while the other leg moves in the air, then the front leg collides with the ground and pushes forward, simultaneously, back legs lifts off the ground. Figure out how to create this realistic motion for the stage 1 model.

- Stage 3 - create a quadruped from the biped model and show natural motion, explain all the elements, the trajectory selection process etc.
  
- You can add more sophistication and elements for more marks, like multiple joints on the legs and so on. The most basic version has a two-piece body with a torsional spring in between. Then front and back legs are connected to the body via planar revolute joints.
